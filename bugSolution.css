To address the order of operations issue, ensure that your `calc()` expression is explicitly parenthesized to force the desired calculation order.  To address unit mismatch problems, always ensure consistent units are used throughout the expression.  For example, using `px` and `%` together can sometimes lead to issues. Consider refactoring complex `calc()` expressions into simpler ones, or using CSS variables for better maintainability and readability.  In this example, instead of nesting calculations, we break them down into individual variables and then use them in the final `calc()` expression. Avoid relying on implicit widths or heights; ensure that the parent element has explicit dimensions if calculating relative values.
